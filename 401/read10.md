# Stacks and Queues
## stacks
#### stacks is when data structures are nodes are referencing each other in one direction
#### stacks follows two concepts:
1. First In Last Out (FILO)
2. Last In First Out (LIFO)
#### Common terminology for a stack:
- `Push` Nodes --> O(1)
- `Pop` or removed Nodes --> O(1)
- `Top` --> O(1)
- `Peek` --> O(1)
- `IsEmpty` --> O(1)
## Queues
#### Queues follows two concepts:
1. First In First Out (FIFO)
2. Last In Last Out (LILO)
#### Common terminology for a Queues:
- `Enqueue` Nodes are added to the queue --> O(1)
- `Dequeue` Nodes are removed from the queue --> O(1) 
- `Front` - first Node of the queue --> O(1)
- `Rear` - last Node of the queue --> O(1)
- `Peek` --> O(1)
- `IsEmpty` --> O(1)
