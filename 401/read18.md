# Cryptography
### Cryptography terminology:
- **Encryption** is scrambling the data according to a secret key
- **Decryption** is recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key
- **Code cracking** is uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques
### Caesar Cipher:
#### Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on
### Cracking the cipher
#### There are three main techniques to crack the cipher which are:
- Frequency analysis:
    - analyze the frequency of the characters in the message and identify the most likely character and narrow down the possible shift amounts based on that
- Known plaintext:
    - is an attack model for cryptanalysis where the attacker has access to both the plaintext, and its encrypted version
- Brute force:
    - for Caesar Cipher The enemy could take some time to try out each of them and find one that yielded a sensible message for just the first word or two.
