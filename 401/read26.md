# Intro to Django
## what is Django?
### Django is an open source Python-based web framework. it enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. it can work with any client-side framework, and can deliver content in almost any format (including HTML, RSS feeds, JSON, XML,... etc). it can also be extended to use other components if needed as (databases, templating engines,... etc). Django helps developers avoid many common security mistakes like providing a secure way to manage user accounts and passwords using a password hash. Django uses a component-based Shared-nothing architecture where each part of the architecture is independent of the others, and can hence be replaced or changed if needed. Django code is written using design principles and patterns that encourage the creation of maintainable and reusable code and  it runs on many platforms.
## Where did it come from?
### Django was initially developed between 2003 and 2005 by a web team who were responsible for creating and maintaining newspaper websites. it has continued to grow and improve, from its first milestone release (1.0) in September 2008 through to the recently-released version 3.1 (2020).
## What does Django code look like?
### Django web applications typically group the code that handles each of these steps into separate files:
