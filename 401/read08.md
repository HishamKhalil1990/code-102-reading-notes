### List Comprehensions consists of: 
- the `expression` that evaluate the list items' values and append it to the list
- `for` loop to repeat the condition 
- `if` condition to determine whether the expression is used or skipped
### the expression can be:
- Multiplying parts (`item*3`) of a list as `multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1]`
- Showing the first letter (`word[0]`) of each word as `items = [word[0] for word in listOfWords ]`
