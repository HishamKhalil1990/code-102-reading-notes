# Ethics
## Google and AI
### The objection of employees to the use of artificial intelligence to manufacture advanced weapons by their company and their refusal to be a party to this project, showed great ethics for the employees who refused to be a reason to harm people or violate their privacy, even if it leads them to resign from their positions and lose  the advantages they enjoy . I agree with what they did because what they did was right, and what had my attention in this article is that their insistence on their demand and their refusal to compromise on it led the company to respond and urged it to set laws and guidelines for its future contracts in the field of artificial intelligence.
## Cyber-Security of self driving cars
### A self-driving car may be useful, but there are risks of hacking self-driving systems and stealing or exploiting the data stored on its hard drive. The article showed some risks related to cyber security and what might happen if terrorists hack cars with the intent of causing accidents. I agree with the article regarding these risks, and I believe that work must be done to develop protection systems for these cars from hacking. What had my attention is that the need to connect to the Internet is what causes concern about the hacking process, as it is the only external port to the system.
