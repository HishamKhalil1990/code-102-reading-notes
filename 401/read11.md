# Data Analysis
## JupyterLab
#### JupyterLab is web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. it enables working with:
- **text** including:
    - syntax highlighting 
    - configurable indentation
- **code console** by providing:
    - transient scratchpads for running code interactively
- **terminals** by providing:
    - full support for system shells on mac linux and power shells on windows
- **common formats** including:
    - handling images format like `jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp` and `.gif`
    - editing `.JSON` and `.VEGA` files
- **jupyter notebook** with two modes:
    - **_command mode_** which used for navigating and changing the framework of the notebook that consists of cells
    - **_edit mode_** which used to code in any text file as (Markdown, Python)
## NumPy
#### NumPy is a Python data analysis package used to speed up a workflow and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem. using NumPy, we can work in multidimensional arrays. to create a NumPy array we use `numpy.array` function. to read directly from a csv or file into arrays using NumPy, `numpy.genfromtxt` function can be used. we can also slicing NumPy arrays and assigning values to NumPy arrays. 
#### NumPy array operations are:
- Single Array Math 
- Multiple Array Math
- Broadcasting
#### also NumPy provides:
- Array Methods as `.sum` which used to find the sum of all the elements in an array
- Array Comparisons 
- Reshaping NumPy Arrays
