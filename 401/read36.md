## The Best Whiteboard Interview Advice
### Take a few minutes
#### Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head. Instead, wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem
#### Restate the question for them and seek affirmation, ask about edge cases and ask about test cases
### Write steps for solution.
#### Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way. just get the steps in order and somewhat readable
### Write pseudocode first
#### Write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work. Do it over on the side of the whiteboard, so you have space left to work
### Don’t sweat the small stuff
#### Programming interviews are about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities.
### Sit down and be humble
#### A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess
### Come prepared
#### In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success. And afterwards, regardless of the outcome, knowing that you could not have reasonably done more to prepare helps you feel proud of your work and start moving towards your next goal.
