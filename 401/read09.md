#### Dunder Methods are a set of predefined methods, start and end with double underscores and they are called also  magic methods. they are used to emulate the behavior of built-in types
#### some of the dunder methods are:
- Object Initialization `__init__`
- Object Representation `__str__` and `__repr__`
- Iteration `__len__`
## Statistics - Probability
#### Probability is the chance of an event happening. To calculate the probability for event to happening, we count how many times it can occur and dividing it by the sample space
#### The distribution of events probabilities is normal distribution. in the normal distribution, the higher point for event the higher probability of occurring.
#### The normal distribution is unique because of two factors:
1. Central Limit Theorem
2. Three Sigma Rule
