## Pain vs. Suffering
#### the way to success and finish code 401 course filled with pain. pain in all fields: physical, mental, and emotional. pain is the price to reach the goal. the greater the growth, the greater the pain. it will push you out of your comfort zone but it will lead you to a new good one. however, suffering is pain for nothing. It makes the pain worse. it is avoidable and it must be avoided. All what it takes is practice. remember: no pain, no gain.
## Big O Notation
#### in computer science, to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm then Big O notation is used. so, what is Big O Notation ?. it the way that programmer used to describe the worst-case scenario, the execution time required and the memory space used. it depends on the nested iterations or recursives are involved in the function. some of the O(N) cases are:
- (N^x) where x depends on the nested iterations as nested for loops
- (x^N) a powerd function where x depends on no. of recursive of the function
## Names and Values in Python
#### name refers to value. so when using names, python serach for the refered value and substitute it in the name place. a specific value can be referred with more than one name. it is done by assign the new name to value original name and so on. however names are assigned independently. so, assignment never copys a data. on the other hand, values exists until they have no referance. values can be divided in two categories which are: 
1. mutable value as in lists
2. immutable value as in strings and integers
